    <p>Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe. By using this app, you agree to these terms of service.</p>

    <h2>Use of the Service</h2>

      You agree not to abuse the app, attempt to interfere with its operation, or use automated
      scripts to submit scores.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>

      We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept
